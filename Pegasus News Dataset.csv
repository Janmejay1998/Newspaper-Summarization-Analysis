Mint,2012-03-23,Views | Dim sum bonds in tandoori land,"In a move that could help them reduce borrowing costs, the Reserve Bank of India last week allowed Indian firms to raise debt in Chinese renminbi, up to a collective total of $1 billion.

Indian companies with trading and investment links with China can now settle transactions by borrowing directly in renminbi, instead of raising money in US dollar and converting it to the Chinese currency, which would be more expensive.

Trade between India and China has grown at 40% year-on-year and stood at $60 billion last year. China remains India’s largest trading partner, accounting for 9.09% of India’s international trade during 2009-10.

Indian power firms could be the biggest beneficiaries. India is targeting 100,000MW of additional electricity capacity in the next five years and needs an investment of over US$400 billion in the power sector to reduce electricity deficits. India’s present power capacity is 170,000MW. Indian firms can now use this facility to finance power sector projects.

Power equipment imports from China have been growing rapidly, much to the irritation of local capital goods companies. According to industry lobby Assocham, Indian power producers have placed orders of power plant equipment, for around 50,000 MW generation capacity, from Chinese suppliers, resulting in a “loss"" of about ₹ 50,000 crore to the domestic equipment manufacturing companies.","The Reserve Bank of India has permitted Indian companies with ties to China to raise debt in Chinese renminbi, allowing transactions to be settled directly in the Chinese currency. This move, aimed at reducing borrowing costs, is particularly beneficial for Indian power firms as the country targets 100,000MW of additional electricity capacity in the next five years, requiring over $400 billion in investment. With India-China trade growing at 40% year-on-year, the facility to borrow in renminbi streamlines transactions and potentially eases financing for crucial power sector projects, despite concerns over the increasing imports of power equipment from China.",Indian power firms could be beneficiaries of a move by India’s central bank to ease their borrowing costs from China.,0.22764227642276424,0.06611570247933884,0.14634146341463417
The Times of India,2003-11-23,Hazare and Patkar: Do or die,"The complete lack of integrity and commitment on the part of all our political leaders has led to a dark and terrible situation in Indian politics.

Political leaders today have a small, sectarian, straitjacketed vision and their own small little axes to grind. The consequences for the country, as we can see, are depressing.

If I had to choose a political leader today, I would choose an amalgam of Medha Patkar, Anna Hazare, Narayana Murthy, and perhaps a small part of V P Singh.

The main quality about someone like Medha Patkar is a do-or-die commitment, which would stand the country in good stead. We need people with integrity and commitment to be our leaders.

Skills can be acquired along the way. Cleverness is a quality that helps people to help themselves, but doesn''t do much good to the country at large. Finally it is commitment that really helps.

One may disagree with Medha Patkar and Anna Hazare, but one can''t question their commitment to their causes. Everyone makes mistakes, Jawaharlal Nehru made mistakes too. But if the overall vision is broad and positive, one can overlook these mistakes.

V P Singh has a lot of failings. But I have always admired his vision. It covers a much broader spectrum than any other politician''s.

Narayana Murthy has more or less the same qualities as Ms Patkar and Mr Hazare. His vision is large, and he has the tenacity to see his dreams and plans through.

The contributions that I would expect from all these people would be very similar to the ones they are already making. They have all chalked out their paths in life and are ready to lay their lives on the line in reaching their targets. Such leadership would definitely do India a world of good.","India's political landscape is criticized for lacking integrity and commitment, leading to a troubling situation. The author envisions an ideal leader as a combination of Medha Patkar, Anna Hazare, Narayana Murthy, and a part of V P Singh. Emphasizing the importance of commitment and integrity over cleverness, the author admires individuals with a do-or-die attitude. Despite acknowledging the leaders' imperfections, the focus is on their broad, positive vision.

The Times of India,2016-01-01,New Year bashes for some turn less groovy and more cozy,"NAVI MUMBAI: It’s not all rock and roll or having a blast at a nearby getaway or hotel for some residents. This time, many citizens preferred to usher in the New Year in their own housing societies and some hosted simple get-togethers at their homes. Radha Srinivasan enjoyed her New Year bash in her Uttara housing society at sector 50, Seawoods, Nerul, as she felt more at ease with her neighbours. “The usual getaways like the Gateway or Juhu beach are too crowded and not safe. Late night party was not possible due to police bandobast. So we celebrated among our own people,” she said.
Palash and Mahua Upadhya from Vashi went to a party thrown by their friend at his residence in sector 7. This year, Upadhyas decided to stay indoors and welcome the new dawn at their friend’s place.
“The large presence of cops at key traffic points reminded us of the recent terrorist activities. So it was a better option to stay in and celebrate,” said Mahua.
Like every year, residents of NRI complex organized a colourful event to usher in New Year. This year’s theme was “white” symbolizing peace and harmony.

That apart, there were DJ, dance, songs and a lavish spread at the event.
The Mukundrajs from that complex enjoyed a cozy get-together with few families at their apartment. The couple, along with guests, kept simple New Year resolutions such as ‘help the poor’, ‘help women in distress’.

Similarly, Vashi resident Neelam Hemrajani resolved to “conserve water”. Srinivasan, too, would rather stick to being “humble for a better tomorrow, instead of making tall promises like ‘quit smoking or rich foods’ which are usually broken by the time the year turns a day or two old”.","Many residents in Navi Mumbai opted for low-key New Year celebrations within their housing societies or intimate gatherings at home, avoiding crowded public places due to safety concerns and heightened police presence. Radha Srinivasan hosted a bash in her society, citing comfort and safety among neighbors. Palash and Mahua Upadhya attended a friend's indoor party due to security concerns. The NRI complex held a themed event promoting peace, while some opted for simple resolutions like aiding the needy or conserving resources. Neelam Hemrajani pledged to conserve water, and Srinivasan emphasized humility over grand resolutions often short-lived.

India Today,2003-11-24,The heroines: LoC-Kargil is all set to be an 11-hankie weepie war movie,"In the gallery of war-film cliches, it is said if a soldier shows a photo of his small-town sweetheart to someone, he is fated to die fairly soon. Now with 11LoCheroes carrying photographs of an equal number of heroines, expect plenty of heartbreak.

Especially because the real soldiers had left behind their beloveds on their trek to the front with touching gestures - cliched, perhaps, but real nevertheless - Captain Vikram Batra had whipped out a blade and cut his finger to apply blood on his college sweetheart Dimple's forehead.

""War is ugly, life is beautiful,"" says Dutta. ""The men are destroyers, the women are creators. They are the real strength behind the men."" True.

.But with the all-male ensemble cast doing the fighting, the women in the sidelines - winsome satellite phone conversations and brief romantic interludes - are almost like an afterthought.

Dutta actually cast the heroines only after his last shooting spell in Ladakh. The bigger heroines - Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukherjee, Esha Deol, Mahima Chaudhary and Raveena Tandon - have walk-on parts while the rest, Preeti Jhangiani, Namrata Shirodkar, Priya Gill, Isha Koppikar, Divya Dutta and Akansha Malhotra have blink-and-you-miss-them appearances.

That did not prevent any of them from flying toLoClike moths to a fleeting flame to be part of the landmark film. Even Kapoor, who famously fought a cold war with Karan Johar last year over her fee, worked for free.
Dutta spent as much time meeting the women who suffered in the sidelines as he did the soldiers, getting photographs and recording footage for the cast to view and get into methodacting mode.

Deol listened to the taped speech of Dimple before she began shooting opposite Abhishek Bachchan while Kapoor pretty much sleepwalked on the sets to play temperamental Delhi girl Simran engaged to Captain Anuj Nayyar (Saif Ali Khan).

The Times of India,2016-05-01,Fitness is freedom: Kunal Kapoor,"Once body-shamed for being skinny, actor Kunal Kapoor tells us how he got his confidence back.
Q: Is there anything as a perfect body type?
No, there’s no such thing as a right or wrong body type or shape. Our society has started to believe and propagate that you have to be a certain body type to be beautiful. We have conveniently created one frame, and try to fit everyone in that frame. Instead of appreciating the differences, we are building a world of clones.

Q: Have you ever been a victim of body-shaming? Yes. We mostly look at body-shaming from the perspective of people who are considered overweight. But the skinny ones also experience it in a big way. I have been a victim of body-shaming in the past – it was a horrible feeling. In my childhood I was often asked if I ate enough. It took a major toll on my confidence level.

Q: How would you define fitness? For me, to fully understand something, it is best to see what it is not. Fitness is not unhealthiness, sickness, unsoundness or illness. To put it simply, fitness is freedom. An ideal fitness level is your ability to perform physical tasks effortlessly and for your mind to actively focus on the task at hand in a stress-free way.

Q: How does fitness impact one’s confidence?
I was a skinny child, with a weak immune system. At the age of 16, I discovered the gym, and it changed my life. Personally, if I don’t work out for even a day, I feel like I am missing out on something really important in life. It could be something as simple as going for a brisk walk, but I make sure I do some kind of exercise daily. Regardless of weight, size, gender or age, a session of workout can quickly elevate a person’s perception of his or her attractiveness and self-worth. To sum it up, exercise makes you feel and look good.

Q: Do you keep re-jigging your workout regimen? What does your fitness timetable look like?
I have always been a fitness-conscious person. The only difference is that earlier I was working on a lean body and now I am working on a muscular body, which is strong from inside out. In a recent film, I played the role of a warrior, and my character had to look very well-built to perform the sword fights. I started to work on my body with my fitness trainer. We trained with everything – from weights and ropes to kettlebells. I went through six months of intense training to achieve this muscular body.

I also practise Kalaripayattu (a form of martial art). I usually start my day with 30 to 45 minutes of cycling. Altering your workout regimen from time to time gives your body the necessary ‘shock’ treatment needed to beat plateau weight.

Q: Why do Indian men develop a paunch?
It’s not a syndrome restricted to Indian men. It may be more prevelant in our country though because we lack the culture of exercise. In Western countries, people are used to walking a lot, cycling to work, participating in various water sports and adventure activities – like surfing, skating etc. for recreation on a daily basis. But fitness-inducing activities aren’t ingrained in our culture and this often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in a beer belly.

Q: What’s you diet like?
You must eat right to enable your body to generate results faster. I try and cut out on foods loaded with ghee, oil, sugar etc. These foods are high on calories, heavy on the tummy and low on nutrition. I worked with a dietician and she put me on a combination of proteins, carbs and healthy fats. The biggest challenge was to curb my sweet cravings. I have a huge sweet tooth and I simply cannot resist anything that has chocolate in it.

Q: Is mental health related to physical health?
Yes. The mind and body are inter- related. Hence, I supplement my workouts with 30 minutes of meditation every day. It has helped me calm down and focus better on what I wish to achieve. Meditation drastically improves your concentration level and you don’t get stressed easily. Do it to believe it.
Q: What does Kunal Kapoor’s workout gear look like?
I have a whole bunch of worn-out tees and shorts. Some of them almost reduced to shreds. But as soon as I wear them, I feel like I am ready to hit the gym. I think it is more of a psychological thing.

TOP 5 FITNESS TIPS
- Understand that your journey to a fitter you isn’t a sprint but a marathon. Accept the fact that it is going to take some time and a lot of hard work. Don’t try to look for shortcuts.
- Find the fun factor in exercise by doing what you enjoy the most. It could be weight training, jogging, playing a sport or even dancing. Whatever you decide to take up, make sure you turn it into a habit and do it regularly.
- Stop giving yourself the most clichéd excuse, 'I don’t have time'. Prioritise exercise no matter how busy you are. An hour of workout seems tough? Start with 10 minutes. It is important to make a beginning. Then gradually increase your workout time.
- Find a workout partner. Sometimes it’s important to work out with someone who motivates you and forces you to stay consistent.

- Never go on crazy diets; they can often lead to deficiencies as you are depriving your body of some nutrients. Instead, eat everything, but in smaller quantities. Indulge in your favourite food item once in a while. Great food is one of the biggest joys of life.

The Times of India,2021-06-04,Toddler and man die as building collapses in Rio de Janeiro,"RIO DE JANEIRO: A four-story building collapsed in western Rio de Janeiro before dawn Thursday, killing at least one infant and one adult and damaging nearby residences, the city's Fire Department said. Four people were rescued from the debris.
The irregular construction consisted of four small homes built atop one another, a spokesperson for the Fire Department said. City officials confirmed to The Associated Press in an email that the structure had no license.
Irregular constructions have long plagued Brazil, which is Latin America's largest nation.
The accident that occurred around 3 a.m. in Rio das Pedras, a working-class neighborhood, underscored the difficulties authorities run into trying to tamp down on illegal constructions in areas run by paramilitary gangs.

Paramilitary groups, commonly referred to as ""militias"" in Brazil, made up of former firefighters, police and soldiers, often take control of public land and build illegal housing to rent informally. Many people choose to live in such residences because they are cheaper.
""With me, militias are not going to build any more crap in this city,"" Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes said Thursday.

According to Rio's Department of Conservation, since January more than 180 irregular buildings have been demolished in the West Zone alone, and more than 150 notifications were also issued. A notification is the first step toward demolition, the department said.

City officials said they had blocked access to seven buildings close to the fallen structure, and all 20 of its residents were relocated.

Maria Augusto da Silva, who lives in the building opposite the one that collapsed, said she started screaming when she heard a terrifying noise in the middle of the night.


""I was desperate, I thought this was the end of the world,"" she said. ""I asked God that it saved me and my family. But the noise kept going and going.""

Once the street got quieter, she grabbed her two young grandsons and fled the house, making her way through the debris outside her doorstep.


The disaster echoed another deadly collapse in the city. In 2019, two condemned buildings that had been built without permits in an area run by illegal militia groups collapsed in Rio, killing two dozen people.
","A four-story building collapsed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, killing at least one infant and one adult, and injuring several others. The irregular construction consisted of four small homes built atop one another, and the structure had no license, according to city officials. The incident highlights the challenges authorities face in controlling illegal constructions in areas influenced by paramilitary groups.

The Hans India,2021-08-13,Now engg study costs a bomb in Telangana,"The decision of the Telangana government to go in for a steep hike in annual fee of engineering colleges has come as a major shock for students and their parents across the State. This gives an excuse for all private institutions to hike fees for the courses they offer as well.

Talking to The Hans India, parents of students who are aspiring to join various engineering courses said the government took a sudden decision to enhance the fee from Rs 18,000 to Rs 35,000 for engineering courses in JNTU and its affiliated institutions at Manthani, Sulthanpur and Jagtial and Osmania Engineering College with immediate effect. The reason for such a hike, the government said, was to overcome the growing financial constraints. It informed its decision to students who are attending the online web counselling from Monday.


The top 10 colleges have been permitted to collect Rs 1.20 lakh annual fee, but the managements were insisting on payment of Rs 1.45 lakh from this year.

Officials of the State Higher Education, TSCHE (Telangana State Council for Higher Education) and Technical Education said there has been no increase of fee after 2019. “The increased fee would be utilised to pay salaries and the maintenance of the universities as the funding to the institutions from the government is not enough to meet the financial requirements.","The Telangana government's decision to significantly raise annual fees for engineering colleges, doubling them from Rs 18,000 to Rs 35,000, has sparked dismay among students and parents statewide. The hike, effective immediately, affects JNTU and affiliated institutions as well as Osmania Engineering College. Despite the government citing financial constraints, parents argue the sudden increase burdens students. Top 10 colleges are allowed to charge Rs 1.20 lakh annually, but some demand Rs 1.45 lakh. Officials attribute the hike to meet salary and maintenance costs, highlighting insufficient government funding since 2019.

The Times of India,2021-06-04,Maratha quota order denudes power of reservation of states,"By Richardson Wilson
Reservation, India’s affirmative action to offset centuries of societal oppression on caste lines, was the offspring of sustained political struggle. Recently, the Supreme Court struck down Maharashtra’s 2018 law conferring 16% reservations on the Maratha community on the grounds that the overall reservation cannot exceed 50% in the state and that after the Constitution 102nd amendment brought into force on August 2018 by the BJP government, states have no power to identify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs).
Article 366 (26C) introduced by this amendment states that SEBCs under the Constitution are only those notified under Article 342A, by the President, in consultation with the governor of the state. This notification can be altered only by an act of Parliament. When this amendment was discussed before the select committee of Parliament, an assurance was given by the government that the proposed amendment does not interfere with the powers of the States to identify SEBCs.
DMK’s Kanimozhi raised concerns in her dissent note about the amendment’s impact on the states’ powers. When the bill was moved, the minister assured Parliament that the states’ powers to include and exclude SEBCs will not be affected. A note of caution was also sounded by DMK MP P Wilson in the Rajya Sabha in March. Despite this, the Supreme Court has held that after the passage of the 102nd amendment, the states have no power to identify the SEBCs.

Before the introduction of Article 342A, the state and Union each had its own list of SEBCs. For example, the Tamil Nadu government had notified 252 Backward Classes based on the social fabric of the state.
The findings of the Supreme Court are contrary to the Union’s stand before the court that the list specified in Article 342A was only the central list, namely the list of SEBCs for central institutions and employment, and not the state list. This stand of the Union government was rejected by the majority opinions of Justice S Ravindra Bhat, Justice L Nageshwara Rao and Justice Hemant Gupta. Thus, we are faced with a unique situation where the court’s interpretation is contrary to the assurances given by the government before the Parliament. The three judges held that such assurances are ""external aids"" and not relevant while interpreting constitutional provisions, where a ‘literal interpretation’ of the provision has to be adopted. Interestingly, the dissenting opinions of Justice Ashok Bushan and Justice Abdul Nazeer rely heavily on these assurances to hold that a ‘purposive construction’ of the Constitution’s provisions are required, to give effect to the intention of the lawmakers.

Therefore, to tide over this situation, the government must necessarily bring in an amendment to Article 342(A), saving the power of the states to identify and notify SEBCs. Otherwise, we would have set a dangerous precedent in the annals of our Parliamentary democracy.


Another offshoot of the Maratha judgment is the Union government’s reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) in forward castes is now in jeopardy. The Supreme Court has reiterated that reservations shall not exceed 50%, except in ""extraordinary situations"". Under central laws, 49.5% reservation is provided for SC, ST and OBCs. The EWS reservation, a challenge to which is pending before the Supreme Court, would breach the 50% mark.

Applying the stringent tests in the Maratha judgment, this EWS reservation would therefore be unconstitutional, since no extraordinary case is made out for grant of these reservations.
","The recent Supreme Court decision striking down Maharashtra’s 2018 law providing 16% reservations for the Maratha community has led to concerns about the fate of reservations for economically weaker sections (EWS) in forward castes in India. The court, emphasizing that reservations should not exceed 50%, has called for a constitutional amendment to safeguard states’ powers to identify and notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs). The fate of the EWS reservation, currently under challenge, is now uncertain, as it would breach the 50% cap. A constitutional amendment may be required to address the situation.

The Hindu,2022-02-05,Sri Lankan Tamils in rehabilitation camps in Ranipet screened,"Sri Lankan Tamils in a rehabilitation camp at Ramanathapakkam village in Walajah taluk in Ranipet district were screened for deformities and other infections related to leprosy on Saturday.

Health officials said the Sri Lankan Tamils in Vellore, Ranipet and Tirupattur districts were not screened for infections related to leprosy for many years. The Public Health Department took the anti-leprosy week celebrations as an opportunity to screen them in their camps starting from Ranipet district. “They are an unscreened population of deformities and other infections related to leprosy for many years. After completing the screening in rehabilitation camps in Ranipet, we will bring other camps in Vellore and Tirupattur under scanner,” B. Preetha, Deputy Director (Leprosy), Vellore, told The Hindu .

The three districts have around 3,500 families, with each rehabilitation camp sheltering at least 300 families. The neighbouring Tiruvannamalai district has 3,550 families.

In the undivided Vellore district (that includes Ranipet and Tirupattur), on an average, 100 - 150 leprosy cases are reported every year. As on January 31 this year, 78 patients are under treatment in these districts and the number of new cases stand at 70. Higher prevalance of the disease is found among migrant labourers in these districts.

Nine-member team
In Ranipet, a nine-member medical team comprising a doctor, a health educator and four health inspectors screened around 100 Sri Lankan Tamil families on the first day of the three-day camp. The team would also screen other residents, including narikuravas and industrial workers, during the fortnight-long campaign against leprosy.

One of the major reasons for late detection of persons affected with leprosy, health officials said, was due to the long incubation period of the disease. It takes, on an average, 3-5 years to detect symptoms of the disease resulting in damage to the nervous system. Some of the symptoms include formation of a large patch for a long period without itching; decrease or total loss of sensation in limbs and foot and clawing of fingers, feet drops. Early detection, for example a single patch, can be treated successfully, health officials said.

The World Leprosy Day in the country is celebrated on January 30 to commemorate the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The date was chosen by French humanitarian Raoul Follereau as a tribute to the life of the Mahatma, who had compassion for people afflicted with leprosy. The 2022 year’s theme was ‘United for Dignity’.","Sri Lankan Tamils in rehabilitation camps in Vellore, Ranipet, and Tirupattur districts, India, are being screened for leprosy-related infections during the anti-leprosy week celebrations.

The condition of several areas in North 24 Parganas worsened after high tide inundated the villages during Yaas. “Embankments got breached in several places and water entered the villages.

The India Express,2003-11-26,"26/11 Mumbai terror attacks: Here’s what happened at Taj Mahal Hotel, Trident-Oberoi, Nariman House","It has been eight years since ten young men stormed into the financial capital of the country with the sole aim of wrecking it to the core — for three consecutive days, the city of Mumbai was wrapped in the grip of terror; eight years since Mumbai was brought down to its knees.

Up until November 2008, terror was associated with the fear that vexed the life of the common man or those unfortunate, inhabiting the disputed borders of the country. For the first time, the bubble of comfort that sheltered the propertied and elite in India was shattered. It was also the first time when foreigners in the country were the target of an attack, transforming a domestic tragedy into one that ended up having significant international ramifications.

But the largest significance of 26/11 lay in the impact that it had on public emotion. Never before had a terrorist attack given rise to public debate of the kind that discussed the role of every element of society in inhibiting terror. From politicians to the country’s security agencies to the media, each failed in its responsibility that eventually claimed the lives of 166 individuals.
The image of the front dome of Taj Mahal Palace hotel encapsulated with a large plume of smoke is one that is etched into the memory of every Mumbaikar. It was not just about the fear of the hundreds trapped inside or the multiple bombings and shootings or the fact that the iconic five-star hotel lay under siege for the longest period of time that made the Taj the face of the 26/11 attacks. Rather, the attack on Taj symbolised something way more powerful. It was a brazen combat against the most affluent and celebrated in the financial capital. It was a brutal strike upon an establishment that symbolised the emergence of an entrepreneurial elite in India.

For more than 60 hours the symbol of opulence in Mumbai lay at the mercy of four heavily armed terrorists.
9:38 pm: Two among the four terrorists, Abdul Rehman Bada and Abu Ali reached the main entrance of the Tower section, having planted a crude RDX bomb in front of the police post nearby. Armed with AK 47s, ammunition and grenades, they made their way to the lobby area, firing on anyone and everyone who caught their sight.

9:43 pm: The other two terrorists, Shoib and Umer, entered through the La-Pat door of the Palace and started shooting down guests in the poolside area. The fact that the terrorists were aware of that the La-Pat door, which is generally closed to public, was open on that particular day for a few corporate meetings and a wedding, was evidence of the intricacy in planning that went behind the attacks.

By the poolside, four foreigners were the first to have been shot down dead by the terrorists along with security guard Ravindra Kumar and his Labrador Retriever.

12:00 am: By midnight Mumbai Police surrounded the Taj. Many of the guests inside the hotel were huddled up by the staff into small rooms by this time.

1:00 am: The central dome of the hotel was bombed and there was a massive fire in the building.

3:00 am: The army and firemen arrived at the location.

4:00 am: The first round of evacuation took place. Two groups were formed by marine commandos. The first group was out safely. The second group was spotted by the terrorists while they were making an exit. Gautam Singh, a tandoor chef at Taj, was one of them. He was shot dead.

November 27 (Thursday)

6:30 am: A team of 200 commandos reached Mumbai from New Delhi and took charge of the rescue operations in Taj and Oberoi. The government gave orders to storm the building. In the succeeding hours, evacuations took place in batches.

10:30 am: Fresh round of gun battle reported from within the building.

4: 30 pm: The terrorists set fire to a room on the fourth floor of the building.

November 28 (Friday)

14: 53- 15:59 pm: Ten grenade explosions reported to have taken place within the premises.

7: 30 pm: Another round of explosions and firing took place.

November 29 (Saturday)

8:00 am: The Indian commandos announced that the Taj had been cleared of all the terrorists.

While the NSG and medical teams sanitised the building after complete evacuation, the fire department was still dousing the last fires in the building. At St, George hospital and JJ hospital body bags kept coming in. The wards were full to their capacity as patients were lying in sheets soaked in blood and tears.
The Oberoi-Trident is the other icon of luxury and opulence in Mumbai that came under the deadly saws of the 26/11 attacks. Being much larger than Taj Mahal hotel in terms of spatial capacity, the rescue operation at the Oberoi-Trident was extremely slow. The two hotels being interconnected, consist of 800 rooms between them. An approximate larger number of hostages were under siege here than at the Taj. Further, bureaucratic failures had led to the security forces being able to enter the building only in the evening.

The Oberoi-Trident plays host to a large number of foreign tourists visiting India and it was the case on the night of 26/11. Foreign nationals were reported to be the prime point of target for the terrorists. By the time the siege ended in Oberoi-Trident, 143 hostages were rescued alive and 24 bodies were recovered.

10:10 pm: Gunfire began at the entrance of Trident with the gatekeeper being the first to fall prey. Two gunmen walked into the reception area and opened fire. Hotel staff including bellboys and hotel management trainees lay injured as the two gunmen made their way to the Opium Den bar, the Tiffin and later the Kandahar restaurants.

The two gunmen walked up the mezzanine level to the spa and killed two Thai masseuses, following which they set off a grenade explosion at the lobby level.

November 27 (Thursday)

12:00 am: The Rapid Action Force positioned themselves outside the building. Friends and kin of those trapped inside stood in the bylanes waiting to hear about their loved ones, hoping they would be rescued.

6:00 am: The police stepped back as the NSG takes over operation at the Oberoi.

6: 45 pm: Explosions and gun battles continue throughout the day. A number of NSG and army personnel are reported to be injured. Evacuation of hostages take place in batches. By now a total of 31 people are rescued.

7: 25 pm: A fire is reported to have broken out in the 4th floor.

November 28 (Friday)

3: 00 pm: The rescue operation at Oberoi comes to an end and both terrorists are killed. As reported by Ritu Sarin, at the end of the 40 hours of trigger alert at Oberoi, the site resembled a camp ravaged.
This attack was distinctive in nature as it was on the Chabad House (a Jewish community centre) run by Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka Holtzberg. The House, located in Colaba, was frequented by large number of Jews, particularly Israeli but also from those visiting the country from across the world.

The couple had moved to Mumbai from Brooklyn in 2003 and taken upon themselves the management of the centre that housed an educational centre, a synagogue and a social hall. The place was a meeting point for foreign Jewish backpackers on their way to holiday destinations in the country, and also for the Jews living in the city.

9:45 pm: Dinner had just ended and the Rabbi along with his wife, his two year old son, Moshe and six guests were getting ready to go to bed when a gunshot was heard. When one of the gunmen came upstairs, a bomb blew off at the petrol pump near the building. Seconds later, an RDX laden device went off near the base of the Nariman House staircase. The terrorists then charged upstairs with gunshots ringing in the air.

The Rabbi and his wife along with their guests were held hostage in the Chabad House for the next nearly 40 hours. The couple’s son, Moshe and the cook managed to escape twelve hours into the siege. According to witnesses, the boy’s pants were drenched in blood when he emerged.

Small craters were all over the floor and bullet marks all across the walls. The stench of decomposed bodies was unbearable. The bodies of the two terrorists lay on the fourth floor.

Photographs of hostages released post the operation give evidence of the torture unleashed on them by the terrorists. The Rabbi’s body was found in the second floor with his legs tied up with a belt. His wife’s body lay nearby. The bodies of two Israeli girls lay beside each other with their hands and legs tied up.
Two militants carried out the shooting inside the city while two others moved towards the Metro cinema.

The Times of India,2021-01-05,"Goa: Women volunteers chip in with funds, care to support Covid +ve","PANAJI: Every evening after 6pm, Ana Gracias, a Chimbel resident finds her phone inundated with calls and text messages from residents in her village who need resources to survive the pandemic.

Sometimes the requests are as simple as provision of a few days’ ration and medication for the home-isolated. For others, the requirement is that of an ambulance or the urgent need to go to the nearest Covid hospital.

“I give ration and cooked meals to the home-isolated, which are donated by priests, besides personally taking people to Goa Medical College if they are symptomatic. There was one case where a woman living in Curca died in her home and her family couldn’t cremate her. I took it upon myself to do her final rites,” Gracias told TOI.
From driving patients to hospitals at odd hours to fostering children of underprivileged Covid patients, there are a few women in Goa who are volunteering to help within their capacity, sometimes with their own funds, even if all they receive in return, at times, is thanklessness.
Diana Tavares, a nurse from Margao, personally visits Covid patients and monitors their health. She also connects them with doctors for phone advice and helps their families arrange oxygen cylinders, oxygen masks and ambulances.

“This is especially in cases where families are not willing to go near the Covid patient for fear of contracting the virus,” she said.

A month ago, Runa Aggarwal, a business consultant, was driving around the city till 4am trying to find an oxygen mask for someone who desperately needed it.

The SOS was posted on a WhatsApp group from an unknown number for a home isolated patient she had never met.

She is always on her feet responding to several such SOSes, irrespective of the time of day, giving hope to humanity.

“There is an army of people risking themselves to ensure that others don’t die. It is the people that are out there doing all this for one another when it’s the government’s duty to do so,” Aggarwal said.
Activist Tallulah Da Silva has taken it upon herself to watch 15 children of underprivileged backgrounds — most of whom are kin of daily wage workers. She keeps them engaged in a backyard class involving art, community farming and learning activities through the day until it is time for them to return home. Six of these children aged between 10 to 16, she has been fostering herself, since their families are struggling with pandemic-related difficulties.

“The children are slowly overcoming their fears and finding their own peace during this turbulent time,” she said.

While most of Goa’s educated community is able to get at least some attention at hospitals and testing centres, the underprivileged are often treated like second class citizens, leaving them hesitant to seek help.

“Many of them don’t want to go to hospitals due to the behaviour meted out towards them, and often don’t even get themselves tested when they show symptoms. They now also have a fear that taking the vaccine will kill them, which is why there is a need to educate them,” Gracias said.

Her efforts to enlighten Chimbel’s Indiranagar slum dwellers with the importance of getting the vaccine has often been snubbed, with some of the migrants even rudely demanding that she leave their doorstep.


“The underprivileged have no access to accurate information and even the government isn’t doing enough to help them. They are totally at the risk of the virus,” said Crystal Lobo Fernandes, a Mapusa resident.

Having lost her job due to the pandemic, Lobo was figuring out how to stand on her feet again when she instead decided to dedicate the entire month of May to volunteer work.


“Women in many areas tend to be more empathetic and can respond better to crisis situations. We have therefore been able to do more than men during the pandemic,” Lobo said.
","In Goa, several women are volunteering their time and resources to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ana Gracias from Chimbel provides ration and meals to home-isolated individuals, helps with hospital visits, and even conducted the final rites for a deceased woman. Diana Tavares, a nurse from Margao, monitors the health of COVID patients, connects them with doctors for advice, and assists with oxygen-related needs. Runa Aggarwal responds to SOS calls for oxygen masks and other resources, while activist Tallulah Da Silva fosters and educates underprivileged children, providing them with a safe space. These women emphasize the importance of community support during the pandemic.","As Goa grapples with the spread of swine flu (Covid) and the number of people dying from the disease soars to more than 100 in the state, a small army of volunteers is working round the clock to ensure that those affected by the virus do not die.",0.2564102564102564,0.03896103896103896,0.14102564102564102

Kerala accounted for the maximum number of COVID-19 cases at 2,522, followed by Karnataka at 568, Maharashtra at 369, and Tamil Nadu at 156.

""We have also made adequate arrangements for medications, PPE Kits and other items which are required to manage the COVID patients. We are keeping a watch on the situation daily.

The missile launch was the eighth of its kind this year. Some experts have said North Korea is trying to perfect its weapons technology and pressure the United States into offering concessions like sanctions relief amid long-stalled disarmament talks. North Korea also might view the U.S. preoccupation with the Ukraine conflict as a chance to accelerate testing activity without any serious response from Washington.

Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the North Korean missile flew about 300 kilometres at a maximum altitude of about 600 kilometres before landing off North Korea’s eastern coast and outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone. No damage to vessels or aircraft has been reported, he said.

“If North Korea deliberately carried out the missile launch while the international community is distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such an act is absolutely unforgivable,” he told reporters. “Whatever the motives are, North Korea’s repeated missile launches are absolutely inexcusable and we cannot overlook considerable missile and nuclear advancement.”

North Korea launched a ballistic missile into the sea on Sunday, its neighbours said, in a resumption of weapons tests that came as the United States and its allies are focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The missile launch was the eighth of its kind this year. Some experts have said North Korea is trying to perfect its weapons technology and pressure the United States into offering concessions like sanctions relief amid long-stalled disarmament talks. North Korea also might view the U.S. preoccupation with the Ukraine conflict as a chance to accelerate testing activity without any serious response from Washington.

Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the North Korean missile flew about 300 kilometres at a maximum altitude of about 600 kilometres before landing off North Korea’s eastern coast and outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone. No damage to vessels or aircraft has been reported, he said.

“If North Korea deliberately carried out the missile launch while the international community is distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such an act is absolutely unforgivable,” he told reporters. “Whatever the motives are, North Korea’s repeated missile launches are absolutely inexcusable and we cannot overlook considerable missile and nuclear advancement.”

South Korean officials said they detected the launch from the North’s capital area and expressed “deep concerns and grave regret” over it.

During an emergency National Security Council meeting, top South Korean officials said the timing of the launch, during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “is not desirable at all for peace and stability in the world and on the Korean Peninsula,” the presidential Blue House said.

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command later on Sunday condemned the launch and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilising acts. A statement said the U.S. commitment to the defence of South Korea and Japan “remains ironclad,” though Sunday’s launch didn't pose an immediate threat to U.S. territory and that of its allies.

The launch came a day after North Korea made its first response to the Ukraine war in the form of an article by a government analyst that expressed support for Russia and slammed the United States.

“The basic cause of the Ukraine incident lies in the high-handedness and arbitrariness of the United States, which has ignored Russia’s legitimate calls for security guarantees and only sought a global hegemony and military dominance while clinging to its sanctions campaigns,” Ri Ji Song, a researcher at a North Korean state-run institute on international politics, said in a post published on the website of the Foreign Ministry.

Ri accused Washington of “arrogance” and “double standards” because it describes its rivals’ defense measures as provocations or injustices.

The former Soviet Union was North Korea’s biggest aid provider before its disintegration in the early 1990s. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been pushing to restore his country’s ties with North Korea in what is seen as a bid to regain its traditional domains of influence and secure more allies to better deal with the United States.

Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the Biden administration needs to show that it maintains a strategic focus on the Indo-Pacific region, including by responding sternly to Pyongyang’s provocations.

“North Korea is not going to do anyone the favor of staying quiet while the world deals with Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” Mr. Easley said. “Pyongyang has an ambitious schedule of military modernisation. The Kim regime’s strength and legitimacy have become tied to testing ever-better missiles.”

North Korea last month conducted seven rounds of missile tests, a record number of monthly launches since leader Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011. North Korea halted testing activity after the start of the Winter Olympics in China, its last major ally and economic pipeline, earlier this month. Some experts had predicted it would resume launches and possibly test bigger weapons after the Games.

Mr. Kim sent a message to Chinese President Xi Jinping after the Olympics calling for further consolidating bilateral ties “into the invincible one” in the face of what he called “the undisguised hostile policy and military threat of the U.S. and its satellite forces.”

Mr. Xi replied to Mr. Kim last week, saying China is ready to strengthen relations, according to North Korea’s state media.

U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear program in return for economic and political rewards collapsed in early 2019 when then-President Donald Trump rejected Kim’s calls for extensive sanctions relief in exchange for limited denuclearization steps during their second summit in Vietnam.

U.S. officials have since repeatedly called for the resumption of talks without preconditions, but Pyongyang has said it won’t return to the negotiating table unless Washington ends its hostility.","North Korea conducted its eighth ballistic missile launch of the year, firing a missile into the sea amid global attention on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The missile, detected by South Korea, flew about 300 km before landing off North Korea's eastern coast. Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi condemned the launch, expressing concerns over North Korea's repeated missile tests. The timing, coinciding with the Ukraine conflict, raised global apprehensions. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command condemned the launch, emphasizing its commitment to defending South Korea and Japan.

The Hindu,2022-03-03,Transitional India could still be more than a handful for Sri Lanka,"Transition is the buzzword as the first Test between India and Sri Lanka begins at the IS Bindra PCA Stadium here on Friday.

It will be Rohit Sharma’s first as Test captain, a role he was handed after Virat Kohli stepped down in dramatic fashion following the series loss to South Africa in January. And, for the first time in over a decade, neither Cheteshwar Pujara nor Ajinkya Rahane will be a part of the eleven.

Main point of discussion
The opening up of two places will make India’s batting the main point of discussion. Even as Kohli, set to play his 100th Test, continues to be the fulcrum, the batting as a whole has come up short in recent times, albeit against some of the world’s best bowling attacks.

Starting from the 2020-21 tour of Australia, India has crossed 400 just once in 18 Test matches — in the second innings against England at the Oval. Admittedly, India has had considerable success during this period, with a world-class bowling attack ensuring that 300-plus totals were adequate.

But in five of the six losses, including the two in South Africa which cost the series, India didn’t cross 300, putting immense pressure on the bowlers.

It remains to be seen who among Shreyas Iyer, Shubman Gill and Hanuma Vihari make the cut. Shreyas averages 52.10 from 56 First Class matches, predominantly playing at No.3. On his Test debut against New Zealand in Kanpur last November, he scored a hundred and a half-century batting at No. 5.

The 27-year-old is also coming off a player-of-the-series performance against Sri Lanka in the T20I series (unbeaten half-centuries in all three matches). Skill-sets may not be transferable, but confidence certainly is.

Gill has played 18 of his 19 Test innings as an opener, but is seen as a natural middle-order bat. Vihari, whenever given the chance, has acquainted himself well.

The bowling though looks loaded, with the pace department, led by vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah, best-placed to exploit the cooler mornings in these parts.

Typically Indian pitch
Rohit, in the pre-match briefing, called the wicket “a typical Indian pitch” and said it would take turn, but without hazarding a guess on when it would start doing so. Regardless, the fit-again spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and R. Ashwin is sure to make Sri Lanka’s job incredibly difficult.

That the visitors have never won a Test in India is an unpleasant fact. The team, on paper, isn’t a patch on great Lankan teams of the past. But the squad does possess seasoned campaigners like Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal who have done well against India. Mathews even has an ODI century in Mohali from 2017.

Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne, set for his 75th Test, will have to shoulder responsibility by continuing his 2021 form of more than 900 Test runs. Wicketkeeper-batter Niroshan Dickwella is back after serving a ban for a bio-bubble breach last year.

India would do well to keep a beady eye on left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya. Impressive at home and most recently against the West Indies when he picked two five-wicket hauls in two Tests, Embuldeniya may relish the spin-friendly conditions and right-hander heavy Indian line-up.

The teams (from): India: Rohit Sharma (Capt.), Jasprit Bumrah (Vice-capt.), Mayank Agarwal, Priyank Panchal, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, K.S. Bharath, R.

The Congress, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, had planned to take out the rally from Dilsukhnagar and end at LB Nagar by paying respects to Srikantha Chary, who was martyred during the Telangana statehood agitation. When Revanth came out of his residence, he was detained by the police. An irate Revanth, seeking the police to show the order copy issued for his detention, flayed the State government asking why Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao and Minister KT Rama Rao were upset if the Congress pays tributes to Srikantha Chary?


Meanwhile, the deployment of heavy police force at Revanth’s house and his detention further triggered tension with several Congress activists exchanging barbs with the police.

TPCC campaign committee chairman Madhu Yashki Goud, convener Ajmath Hussain and the party activists were too detained by the police who stated that there was no permission given to take out the rally.

Meanwhile, Sanga Reddy MLA Jagga Reddy took a strong dig at the TRS government and condemned the police action of arresting Congress leaders. He said the dreams of youngsters and students who participated and sacrificed their lives in Statehood agitation remain unfulfilled even after seven years of TRS rule.

The Hans India,2021-10-05,Two US scientists share Nobel Prize for Medicine David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian awarded jointly the prize for discovery of temperature and touch receptors,"Two US-based scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their discovery of the receptors that allow humans to feel temperature and touch.


David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian focused their work on the field of somatosensation, that is the ability of specialised organs such as eyes, ears and skin to see, hear and feel.

“This really unlocks one of the secrets of nature,” said Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel Committee, in announcing the winners. “It's actually something that is crucial for our survival, so it's a very important and profound discovery.”

The committee said Julius, 65, used capsaicin, the active component in chilli peppers, to identify the nerve sensors that allow the skin to respond to heat. Patapoutian found separate pressure-sensitive sensors in cells that respond to mechanical stimulation, it said.


The pair shared the prestigious Kavli Award for Neuroscience last year.

“Imagine that you're walking barefoot across a field on this summer's morning,” said Patrik Ernfors of the Nobel Committee. “You can feel the warmth of the sun, the coolness of the morning dew, a caressing summer breeze and the fine texture of blades of grass underneath your feet. These impressions of temperature, touch and movement are feelings relying on somatosensation.""

“Such information continuously flows from the skin and other deep tissues and connects us with the external and internal world. It is also essential for tasks that we perform effortlessly and without much thought,” said Ernfors.


Perlmann said he managed to get hold of both of the winners before the announcement. “I [...] only had a few minutes to talk to them, but they were incredibly happy,” he said. “And as far as I could tell they were very surprised and a little bit shocked, maybe.”

Last year's prize went to three scientists who discovered the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus, a breakthrough that led to cures for the deadly disease and tests to keep the scourge from spreading though blood banks. The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over USD1.14 million). The prize money comes from a bequest left by the prize's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895. The prize is the first to be awarded this year.

Presiding over the first Division Bench along with Justice D. Bharatha Chakravarthy, the Chief Justice said, it had become a routine to see well laid roads and pavements being dug and re-laid repeatedly for one work or the other. He said, there must be a mechanism in place and machines must be deployed to lay underground cables without causing much damage to the roads.

The Chief Justice lamented that it had become a common practice for Greater Chennai Corporation to repeatedly keep relaying roads because one agency after another keeps digging them for carrying one work after another. He expressed his anguish during the hearing of a contempt of court petition against a former Corporation Commissioner for poor maintenance of roads in the city.

When the litigant’s counsel submitted certain photographs, the corporation counsel said that Tangedco had dug roads at various places and that the corporation was relaying those roads.

This is said to be the first such initiative, which the SEC has brought in with the support of the Emerging Technologies Wing of the IT department and the technical development by Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC).


The initiative originated from the SEC’s plan to enable ‘e-Voting’ facility to certain sections of voters such, as persons with disabilities, senior citizens,those employed in notified essential services, sick people, polling personnel, IT professionals. The SEC partnered with the emerging technologies wing, whose mandate is to support the govt tech projects, to initiate the development and deployment of project on a pilot basis by leveraging emerging technologies to ensure it meets the strict requirements of voting process.

The solution has been successfully developed and tested, and its dry run in the form of a dummy election is being conducted in Khammam district with the registration of the application open from October 8 to 18 and the dummy voting on October 20. Although the initial scope was limited to a subset of citizens, the dry run is open for all citizens of the district.

The solution leverages Artificial Intelligence for a three-factor authentication of valid voter viz. Name Matching with Aadhaar, live detection of individual and image matching with EPIC database (with up to 15-20 year records). Further, Blockchain (distributed ledger) technology has been used to secure the de-identified and encrypted votes so that they are maintained as immutable records.


The smartphone application follows a minimalist design approach and supports both English and Telugu, and also has a detailed help section with tutorial videos and helpline number to aid the citizens. The ‘TSEC eVote’ Android app, to be used for the dry run, is a Security Hardened Mobile Application to prevent tampering and also binds a device ID and phone number to a specific citizen registration process such that only the same device can be used during voting, thereby enhancing security by design itself. The entire process can be monitored and controlled by the administration using a web portal, wherein the generation/access of results is further protected with the requirement of a physical security token based decryption. Additionally, the entire data is being stored in the State Date Centres (SDCs) as an added security consideration.","The State Election Commission (SEC) introduces a smartphone-based e-voting solution, facilitated by the Emerging Technologies Wing and technical support from CDAC.

The Hans India,2021-10-09,KCR tears apart Fasal Bima Yojana Calls Centre’s crop insurance scheme a bogus,"“The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is Bogus. It is an unscientific crop insurance scheme that is being implemented in the country. It is full of shortcomings and needs to be rectified to ensure that the benefit reaches every farmer who lost a crop due to natural calamities.”


This was the reaction of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in an intervention during question hour on the last day of the Assembly session which was held for seven days and deliberated over issues mostly focused on the Huzarabad bypoll for about 35 hours.

KCR said the procedure in vogue is that the state governments submit a preliminary report to the Centre on the losses suffered by farmers due to rains and floods. The Union Government sends a team to assess the damage very late, almost after three or four months. As a result, the entire process to extend assistance to the farmers gets delayed. “The Centre is silent despite the MS Swaminathan and Ashok Gulati committee making several recommendations to streamline the crop insurance scheme,” he said.

The Chief Minister also pointed out that during assessment for crop insurance, the claim is approved only if an entire village or mandal gets affected. “A section of farmers, who suffer losses in a village in a mandal are deprived of the crop insurance benefit. Farmers are fed up and are reluctant to pay the premiums as they are not able to get the benefit from the insurance scheme.

He had also sought to reserve the Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency for himself. The BJP though will have to balance Mr. Paswan and the breakaway faction headed by his uncle and Union Minister Pashupati Nath Paras. 



Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Paswan, whose politics in the last five years has been centred on confrontation with Mr. Kumar, said that he is happy that the NDA government is in power and expressed hope that the vision of the allies will also be incorporated in the government’s policy. “In 2019 too, we had JD(U) on board and we managed to amicably fix the seat-sharing formula between us. The conversation on the division of seats has started on a positive note and I believe it will be finalised soon,” Mr. Paswan said. However, he sounded a word of caution, saying if Mr. Kumar continues to pursue the “policies” that he was critical of under the new government, then he will not be reluctant to speak out.

Mint,2011-08-19,"European stocks extend rout, gold soars","
London: A selloff in global stocks gathered pace on Friday, reflecting mounting concerns the US economy is heading into another recession and as some European lenders faced a short-term funding crunch, highlighting the risk of a banking crisis.

Nervous investors fled to the safety of core government bonds, Swiss francs and gold, which hit a record high, with many seeking to unwind holdings of riskier assets such as stocks, commodities and higher-yielding currencies before the weekend.

European shares extended steep losses from Thursday, when they suffered their biggest daily slide in 2-1/2 years, with key indexes in Britain, France and Germany deep in the red.

US stock index futures pointed to a sharply weaker open for equities on Wall Street, a day after the Nasdaq shed more than 5% and the S&P 500 tumbled 4.5% on rising recession fears.

Futures for the S&P 500, the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq 100 were down by between 1.4 and 1.5%.

A short selling ban imposed on financial stocks by some European stock markets last week has had little impact. Shares in Europe’s biggest banks fell to their lowest in more than two years on funding fears, taking the weekly fall to near 10% and leaving the battered sector on course for a fourth straight week of declines.

“There has been a panic about European banks. European governments are guaranteeing European banks, but if the governments are not stable themselves, that means the banks aren’t stable,"" said Lothario Mendel, chief investment officer at Octopus Investments, which manages $4 billion.

Worries about a European banking crisis kept the euro under pressure and it was last down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.4310.

The MSCI world equity index was down 1.4%. It has matched the losses in European stocks since the start of the month, with $1.4 trillion being wiped off valuations on Thursday and early on Friday -- equivalent to the size of the Spanish economy.

“At the moment the market is just looking for relative safe havens,"" said Mitsui Precious Metals analyst David Jollie. “You can see that in the selloffs across equity markets. The strength of gold is the other side of the coin from that.""

Exane BNP Paribas, in a note, said a global recession was far from priced in by financial markets. Another global slump could see corporate earnings plunge 35% from peak to trough, implying a 50% cut to consensus earnings per share estimates.

The sharp decline in stock markets is expected to have an adverse impact on household wealth, further undermining consumer confidence and demand in coming months. Heightened uncertainty over growth could also see producers delaying decision-making, hitting global output.

Those concerns are likely to see investors cut exposure to stocks, metals and oil, and growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar in the coming days, unless the US Federal Reserve signals more quantitative easing or European politicians take decisive actions to stem contagion risk from the euro zone debt crisis.

CRUNCH TIME

While investors fled stocks, spot gold hit a record high of $1,867.30 an ounce, putting it on track for the largest weekly gains since February 2009. The metal has rallied nearly 14% so far this month -- its best month since September 1999 -- benefiting from a deluge of safe-haven flows.

Oil prices fell, with Brent crude extending losses on renewed expectations of weak demand from the world’s top oil consumer after a slew of lacklustre US data.

Brent fell as low as $105.06 a barrel, and has lost more than 9% this month, the worst slide since a near 15% drop in May 2010.

A string of data on Thursday revived concerns the United States could be heading for another recession, led by a sharp drop in factory activity in the US Mid-Atlantic region to its lowest level since March 2009, which stunned investors.

An unexpected fall in existing US home sales in July and a bigger-than-expected rise in new claims for jobless benefits in the latest week also added to a fresh bout of risk aversion.

Renewed fears that the euro zone debt crisis could engulf the region’s financial system put pressure on short-term funding markets, forcing some European banks to pay higher rates for dollar loans and reviving memories of the dark days of late 2009 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

German Bund futures fell, but were still in sight of record highs as worries over a global slowdown and the euro zone debt crisis provided underlying support.","Global stocks experienced a sharp selloff, deepening concerns about a potential US recession and highlighting European lenders' funding challenges.

Mint,2007-08-06,Indian MFs go global in big way,"Indian asset management companies recently launched an array of international funds to diversify the portfolio of Indian investors.

In September 1999, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) issued a circular restricting overseas investments only to an American Depository Receipt (ADR) or a Global Depository Receipt (GDR) and that also only of Indian companies, provided the investments did not cross the limit of $500 million (Rs2,015 crore). An ADR is a certificate issued by a bank in the US representing a certain amount of shares of a foreign company on a foreign exchange. They can be traded on American exchanges just like domestic stock. GDRs are similar. Under the 1999 circular, mutual funds only could invest in those foreign companies that had a 10% stake in an Indian company listed in a recognized Indian stock exchange. Therefore, for Indian mutual funds, the universe of stocks was restricted to about 47 companies.

Sebi revised its policy recently allowing investments in ADRs/GDRs of global companies. Under the revised guidelines, mutual funds now can invest in ADRs/GDRs/foreign securities within an overall limit of $3 billion (Rs12,090 crore). The rider is a sub-ceiling for individual mutual funds—the investment should not exceed 10% of the net assets managed as on 31 March of each fiscal and subject to a maximum of $150 million (Rs604.5 crore) per mutual fund.

According to Ms. Lawrence, “India wasn’t born on August 15, 1947; it was born on the day the Constitution came into existence for, 565 princely states were brought together after the independence to form a country called India. Hence, India came into being when it was united with multiple princely states, cultures, and ethnicity.” She believes that caste connects India. “Diversity isn’t always good; culturally, caste-wise, it is always a problem,” she adds.

Performance and patriotism
The session veered around to women nationalists who played an instrumental role in India’s freedom struggle. Ms. Ratnam portrayed Captain Lakshmi Sehgal, who went on to head the all-women’s regiment of the Indian National Army set up by Subash Chandra Bose, inspiring several women to join her. The performance is part of a longer production called the “Warrior Women of Bharat”. Ms. Narayan portrayed Begum Hazrat Mahal, the favourite queen of the Nawab of Awadh, who set herself to the task of deconstruction of Awadh, after the British took over on charges of mismanagement. She managed to keep them at bay for 10 years before they retaliated.

Ms. Ratnam said, “The discovery I made while researching this piece was, as we recuperate these historical figures, we must also ask, ‘whom are we not representing?’”

Ms. Lawrence added that there were women who had been actively involved in the freedom struggle, who didn’t get credit, while many others remained invisible. “Whilst Gandhi and Bose wanted women to fight with them, they didn’t see things through the lens of a woman. The freedom movement only talks about the British and sending them away from us, but it never talks about the civil rights movement. There were women who weren’t allowed to cover their upper bodies on one hand, while on the other, there were women fighting for the nation.”

Ms. Narayan spoke about how the male ego’s perception is often far from reality. “It shows their insecurity in a particular gender who is unable to come to terms that the other gender can contribute.” She also said that while we had achieved freedom eventually, women needed to free themselves from the fear of change.

The session concluded with the common consensus that women must find their spaces, left or right, and be intersectional.

The Hans India,2021-10-11,Digital land survey yet to take off,"Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s dream project- Digital Survey of Agricultural Lands - is yet to take off as the government has not finalised the villages to be surveyed.


The chief minister had announced the launch of a survey on pilot basis in 27 villages, including a few in KCR’s Gajwel Assembly Segment from July 11 this year.

Top officials shared with The Hans India that no steps have been taken towards the launch of the survey due to various reasons. The delay in the identification of the villages by the district authorities and the private agencies to take up the survey work are cited as the reasons.

Conducting a full-scale digital survey was not possible unless the agencies have appropriate technology and tools to take up the work. This has become a major challenge as agencies with the state- of- the- art technologies and expertise to conduct the land survey digitally were not available.


The objective of the survey is to fix boundaries with geographical coordinates and address the permanent solution to the growing land disputes in the State. Under the pilot project, the survey was to be conducted first in dispute-free villages, followed by villages with both forest and government lands with disputes. The objective is to gain field experience in surveying villages with and without land disputes, based on which rules and guidelines will be finalised to conduct a full-scale digital survey across the State.

After the survey of agricultural lands, the government had planned to take up the exercise regarding urban lands. The entire exercise of digital survey is to help update all the land records and preserve them in the tamper-proof Dharani portal which came into operation last year.

Only a few districts like Nalgonda, Khammam, Siricilla and Siddipet, authorities had sent the village names to conduct the survey and most of the other districts have not responded to the finalisation of villages to the farm land survey. “The identification of four villages in KCR’s Gajwel segment was also pending,” said an official. Without identifying the villages, the schedule cannot be finalised for the survey.","Telangana's Digital Survey of Agricultural Lands, a key project led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, faces delays as villages for the pilot survey remain unidentified.

The relative-strength index of futures in New York has topped 70 since 8 August, a signal to some investors that prices were poised to decline. Bullion has jumped 15% in August, heading for the biggest monthly gain since September 1999, amid speculation that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will signal further measures to stimulate the US economy later this week and as debt crises spurred demand for haven assets.

Gold looks very bubbly, Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. Gold’s going to continue to suck everybody in. There’s too much risk of a wicked correction lurking around the corner to enter the trade right now, he added.

Gold futures for December delivery fell $12.1, or 0.6%, to $1,879.80 an ounce at 10.34am on the Comex in New York. The metal for immediate delivery declined as much as 1.7% after reaching a record $1,913.50 in London.

Before Tuesday, prices surged 17% in three weeks. The metal is in the 11th year of a bull market, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek to diversify holdings away from equities and some currencies. Bullion also reached all-time highs in euros, British pounds and Swiss francs today.

Gold’s climb in the past several weeks surprised most in the market, even those in the most bullish camp, Edel Tully, an analyst at UBS AG in London, wrote in a report on Tuesday. Given the speed of the recent rally, the possibility of a correction is rising as investors look to bank profits. “Even if a $150 or more pullback were to materialize, we’d strongly view it as a good buying opportunity,"" said Tully.

Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products fell for a second day on Monday, sliding 4.7 tonnes to 2,206.4 tonnes, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record 2,216.8 tonnes on 8 August.

UBS raised its one-month gold forecast to $1,950 from $1,725 and increased its three-month outlook to $2,100 from $1,850. On Monday, the bank’s physical sales to India, the top global buyer, were the highest since 10 May, Tully said.

Bernanke is scheduled to speak on 26 August in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at an annual conference sponsored by the Fed Bank of Kansas City.

In the long term, gold is attractive, Zeman of Kingsview said. Fiscal deficits are completely out of control. It’s no wonder that investors are losing faith in paper money.

Silver futures for December delivery fell 16.5 cents, or 0.4%, to $43.2 an ounce on Comex. Before Tuesday, prices have gained 40% this year.

Platinum futures for October delivery fell $18.7, or 1%, to $1,887 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange after reaching $1,918.50, the highest since July 2008.

The notification is to come into effect from October 14.


The KRMB had rejected the repeated pleas of the State government to defer taking over of the projects till the issue of sharing of water between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh was resolved.

The ongoing fight between the Telangana government and the Centre is set to intensify on sharing of Krishna river water. The State government has rejected the KRMB’s appeal to hand over the projects to the board.

The State has categorically told the board that no project would be handed over to it until water-sharing disputes between the two Telugu States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are resolved.


The board in a statement said that “All the direct outlets (components) from the main reservoirs of Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects which are listed under Schedule-2 of the gazette notification may be prioritized by respective State governments for handing over to the KRMB by October 14.”

The board convened a meeting with the officials of Telangana Irrigation department over the issue.

During the marathon meeting, the officials of Telangana said that their demand for sharing of water on 50:50 basis should be first accepted.


State Special Chief Secretary to Irrigation Rajath Kumar explained the hurdles facing in the utilization of river Krishna water due to prolonged delay in resolving the water sharing issue. Telangana has been demanding 570 TMC of water from Krishna as the water needs increased after the completion of the pending lift and irrigation schemes.

The government was not ready to hand over the hydel power generation centre at Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam projects. The Telangana state was depending on the hydel power to meet the energy needs mainly the 24-hour free power supply to agriculture.

The State was not ready to lose the ownership of hydel units in the crisis time, Rajath Kumar told the board.


He said the government was seeking legal opinion on the KRMB statement and would take appropriate decision by Wednesday.

According to the gazette, the projects that would be taken over are Srisailam spillway, Srisailam right bank hydel unit, Pothireddypadu, Pump house at Handri – Niva and Muchumarri lift schemes in Andhra Pradesh would be maintained by the KRMB.

The Spice-2000 bombs used in the Balakot strikes were the penetrator version which made holes using their weight in the concrete rooftops of the buildings
NEW DELHI : In a major boost for India's aerial firepower, the Indian Air Force is set to receive the 'building blaster' version of the Balakot air strike-fame Spice-2000 bombs by mid-September.

Top IAF sources told ANI that the Spice-2000 bombs are scheduled to be delivered to the Indian Air Force (IAF) from Israel around mid-September along with the Mark 84 warhead and bombs which can destroy buildings completely.
The supply of these weapons from Israel will happen around the time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to visit India for a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Indian Air Force had signed a contract with Israel in June this year for acquiring more than 100 Spice 2000 bombs under the emergency procurement powers of the services given by the Narendra Modi government.

The contract was signed as the Air Force wanted to acquire the bombs after their successful usage in the Balakot airstrikes against a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Pakistan.

During the Balakot strikes, the Air Force had dropped Spice-2000 bombs from Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft after a pack of 12 of these fighters crossed the Line of Control to strike the Jaish facility in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

However, the Spice-2000 bombs used in the Balakot strikes were the penetrator version which made holes using their weight in the concrete rooftops of the buildings in the Jaish camp which don't destroy buildings but explode inside killing people with the mix of 70-80 kg explosives with shrapnel.

Under the emergency powers, the three services could buy any equipment of their choice worth up to ₹300 crore to prepare for any hostilities.
